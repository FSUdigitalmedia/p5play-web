# LICENSING

> This file contains a non-legally binding summary of p5play's licenses. Click on the links below to read the full text of each license.

## p5play v3 library

Anyone can use p5play for free under the terms of the [AGPLv3][] (Affero General Public License), a copyleft open source license. üéâ

But if you want to use p5play commercially in a closed source product or service, you must comply with the [p5play Novice License][] or [p5play Professional License][] agreements.

Here are some examples of commercial use:

- publishing a paid or monetized game on an app store
- teaching at a school that charges tuition
- writing curriculum for a paid course
- developing a game for a paying client
- monetizing an API service or website

## p5play Novice License

If you're a student, independent developer, or small development team and can't afford to pay to use p5play commercially, you can apply to obtain the [p5play Novice License][] for free. By applying, you affirm that you are a low-income applicant as defined in the license.

This license exists to give novice developers the opportunity to use p5play commercially. If you can afford to pay for a professional license, please do so to support the development of p5play.

To apply, email info@p5play.org with the title "novice". In the body of the email write a brief description of how you plan to use p5play commercially. If you're approved, you'll be added to the [p5play-novice][] README.md.

## p5play Professional License

The [p5play Professional License][] is only available to current p5play [Patreon][] or [GitHub Sponsors][] members paying for the appropriate tier.

p5play's business model of multi-licensing enables free use for non-commercial purposes, while requiring commercial users to pay for a proprietary license. This business model is similar to the one used by Qt, MySQL, and other successful open source projects.

If you financially benefit from using p5play, it's only fair that you [support its development][]! ü§ù

## AGPL Commercial Use Limitations

Technically, you can use p5play commercially on some platforms without a novice or professional license, but then you would need to comply with the AGPL's restrictions.

Under the terms of the AGPL, open source commercial use would require that you make potential consumers aware of their ability to download readable (non-obfuscated) source code at or before the point of sale, as a free alternative to making any purchases. Note that your source code must include any requisite material, not limited to program files.

Closed app stores, like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, do not allow developers to publish apps that contain software licensed under the AGPL.

Non-profit organizations [must also comply][] with the AGPL conditions on commercial use if they sell any products or services. This includes private and charter schools that charge tuition but not public schools that are funded by taxes.

Violating the terms of the AGPL is intellectual property theft.

## Personal Note on Licensing

Hi I'm Quinton Ashley, the creator of p5play v3.

I've spent thousands of hours over the past two years developing p5play but I still haven't been able to meet the community's demand for new features. I want to find a way to work on p5play full time and eventually hire other developers to help make p5play the best it can be. That's why I need your financial support!

I think I've found a good balance between open source and monetization with the multi-licensing model.

On the one hand, I wanted to offer p5play as a fully featured game engine to anyone that might be interested in using it. I didn't want users to feel like it lacked core features that they'd need to pay a premium for. I also believe that the only way to deeply learn how software works is being able to look at the source code. Open source also gives everyone the ability to make suggestions and improvements to the library.

On the other hand, I want p5play to generate revenue so I can continue to develop it and make it better. I think p5play's ease of use compared to other game engines has real value and it's why people are willing to support the project financially.

If you have a strong opinion about p5play's business model, I'd like to hear it! Please send me an email to info@p5play.org

## p5play logos

The current p5play logos were created by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. The p5play logo can be found in the "assets" folder of this p5play-web repository in a file named "logo.svg". You are encouraged to reference it and/or the "made_with_p5play.webp" images in your own projects to show that your project was made with p5play, but you may not imply that your project is endorsed by Quinton Ashley.

## p5.play v1 and v2

p5.play v1 and v2 are licensed under the LGPLv2 license, a more permissive copyleft license than the AGPLv3. p5play v3 only re-implements portions of the p5.play API, so it doesn't qualify as a derivative of previous versions. APIs are not copyrightable in the United States, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Oracle v Google case.

## p5play.org website

## Contributions to p5play

In the future, I would like to hire developers to help me work on p5play but unfortunately, I can't afford to pay anyone right now. If you're interested in working for p5play send an email to info@p5play.org with your resume and a link to your GitHub profile.

Currently, if you'd like to make contributions to the p5play library, you can do so on a volunteer basis. Significant contributions to the p5play library will be credited on the home page of p5play.org and in the p5play changelog on GitHub, unless you'd prefer to make contributions anonymously.
