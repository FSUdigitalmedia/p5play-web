# LICENSING

The p5play v3 library itself is licensed under the GPLv3 only. I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that if you intend to make a derivative version of p5play, which means copying the code in part or whole and making your own edits to it, then you must release your work publicly under the GPLv3 only license as well. You can make commericial games using p5play, but you must release the source code for your game as well. If you would like to use p5play in a closed-source project, you must contact the sole copyright holder, Quinton Ashley, for permission: info@p5play.org

The p5play v3 logos were created by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. The primary p5play logo is in the root folder of this p5play-web repository in a file named "logo.svg". You can reference it in your own projects to show that your project was made with p5play, but you may not imply that your project is endorsed by Quinton Ashley.

p5.play v2 and v1 are licensed under the LGPLv2 license. p5play v3 does not qualify as a derivative of previous versions because it is a complete reimplementation of the p5play API. APIs are not copyrightable in the United States, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Oracle v Google case.

The JavaScript example code and non-logo images shown in the mini-editors on the p5play website are public domain works licensed under the CC0 license. You are free to copy and modify them for use in your own projects without attribution.

The lessons and everything else in this repository, "p5play-web", is owned by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. This content is publicly available to be read and referenced in your own projects, but you may not copy the content to a greater extent than fair use allows without permission from Quinton Ashley.

Any contributions made to the p5play library, p5play editor app, and/or p5play.org become the intellectual property of Quinton Ashley. By contributing to the p5play and p5play-web repositories, you forfiet any copyright claims over your work for the benefit of the p5play community. Any contributions to the p5play v3 library will be credited on the home page of p5play.org and in the p5play v3 changelog on GitHub unless you'd prefer to make contributions anonymously.
