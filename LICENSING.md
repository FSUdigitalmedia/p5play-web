# LICENSING

The p5play v3 library itself is licensed under the GPLv3 only, a copyleft license.

I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the license allows you to make commercial projects, such as games or education tools, using p5play v3, but only if you publicly release readable source code for your project as well.

It is therefore illegal copyright infringement to use p5play in any closed source commercial project without obtaining an exemption to this rule from the sole copyright holder, Quinton Ashley. Such exemptions are afforded in the GPL v3 by section 7 which states "Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions."

One way to obtain an exception is by being a p5play Patreon member. The only other way is to be publicly listed as exempt by Quinton Ashley on his p5play-exceptions page on GitHub.

Contact Quinton Ashley by email for more information: info@p5play.org.

If you intend to make a derivative version of p5play, which means copying the code in part or whole and making your own edits to it, then you must release your work publicly under the same GPLv3 only license, meaning that derivatives of p5play must also be open source. I would prefer that derivatives only exist for the purpose of contributing back to the main p5play library, for the benefit of the p5play community.

The current p5play logos were created by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. The p5play logo can be found in the "assets" folder of this p5play-web repository in a file named "logo.svg". You can not use it to imply a derivative work is original or was created by Quinton Ashley. You are encouraged to reference it and/or the "made_with_p5play.png" images in your own projects to show that your project was made with p5play, but you may not imply that your project is endorsed by Quinton Ashley.

p5.play v2 and v1 are licensed under the LGPLv2 license. p5play v3 does not qualify as a derivative of previous versions because it is a complete re-implementation of the p5play API. APIs are not copyrightable in the United States, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Oracle v Google case.

The example code and non-logo images shown in the mini-editors on the p5play website are public domain works licensed under the CC0 license. You are free to copy and modify them for use in your own projects without attribution.

The lessons and everything else in this repository, "p5play-web", is owned by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. This content is publicly available to be read and referenced in your own projects, but you may not copy the content to a greater extent than fair use allows without permission from Quinton Ashley.

Any contributions made to the p5play library, p5play editor app, and/or p5play.org become the property of Quinton Ashley, unless a superseding agreement is arranged. By contributing to the p5play and p5play-web repositories, you forfeit any copyright claims over your work for the benefit of the p5play community. Any contributions to the p5play library will be credited on the home page of p5play.org and in the p5play changelog on GitHub unless you'd prefer to make contributions anonymously.
