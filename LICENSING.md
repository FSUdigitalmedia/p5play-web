# LICENSING

> This file contains a non-legally binding summary of p5play's licenses.

Typical use of p5play by educators and commercial game developers requires a proprietary license. See the [Pro][] and [Teach][] pages for more information.

## p5play v3 library

p5play is open source and multi-licensed.

Anyone can use p5play for free under the terms of the [AGPLv3][], a copyleft open source license.

The AGPLv3 requires that any works which incorporate p5play for non-personal use must be made publicly open source.

Technically, you can use p5play commercially on some platforms without a proprietary license.

Yet, under the terms of the AGPL, open source commercial use would require that you make potential consumers aware of their ability to download readable (non-obfuscated) source code at or before the point of sale, as a free alternative to making any purchases. Note that your source code must include any requisite material, not limited to program files.

Closed app stores, like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, do not allow developers to publish apps that contain software licensed under the AGPL.

Non-profit organizations not paying for one of p5play's proprietary licenses must also comply with the AGPL, including non-profit schools that charge tuition. https://www.beavandenberk.com/ip/copyright-tm/nonprofits-and-the-fair-use-defense/

## p5play.org website

The example code and non-logo images shown in the mini editors on the p5play website are public domain works licensed under the CC0 license. You are free to copy and modify them for use in your own projects without attribution.

Everything else in this repository, "p5play-web", is owned by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. This content and its source is publicly available, but you may not copy the content to a greater extent than fair use allows.

The interactive textbook, [_Learn p5play_][], is free for personal use only.

## p5play logos

The current p5play logos were created by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. The p5play logo can be found in the "assets" folder of this p5play-web repository in a file named "logo.svg". You are encouraged to reference it and/or the "made_with_p5play" images in your own projects to show that your project was made with p5play, but you may not imply that your project is endorsed by Quinton Ashley.

## p5.play v1 and v2

p5.play v1 and v2 are licensed under the LGPLv2 license, a more permissive copyleft license than the AGPLv3. p5play v3 only re-implements portions of the p5.play API, so it doesn't qualify as a derivative of previous versions. APIs are not copyrightable in the United States, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Oracle v Google case.

## Contributions to p5play

Currently, if you'd like to make contributions to the p5play library, you can do so on a volunteer basis. Significant contributions to the p5play library will be credited on the home page of p5play.org and in the p5play changelog on GitHub, unless you'd prefer to make contributions anonymously.
