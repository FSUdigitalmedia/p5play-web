# LICENSING

## p5play v3 library

You can utilize p5play in a closed source project if at least ONE (1) of the following conditions is met:

1. You are a current [p5play Patreon][] member paying for the appropriate tier.

2. You are publicly listed by Quinton Ashley on his [p5play-exceptions][] page on GitHub.

3. You publicly release the source code for your entire project.

p5play is licensed under the GPLv3, a copyleft license. Violating the terms is intellectual property theft. Cease and desist letters will be sent to suspected violators.

Quinton Ashley is the sole copyright holder of p5play. Exceptions are afforded by the GPL v3 in section 7 which states "Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions." If an exception is not obtained, potential consumers must be made aware of their ability to download readable (non-obfuscated) source code at or before the point of sale, as a free alternative to making any purchases. Note that your source code must include any requisite material, not limited to program files.

[Non-profit organizations must also comply with the above conditions on commercial use.](https://www.beavandenberk.com/ip/copyright-tm/nonprofits-and-the-fair-use-defense/)

Contact Quinton Ashley by email for more information:
info@p5play.org

If you intend to make a derivative version of p5play, which means copying the code in part or whole and making your own edits to it, then you must release your work publicly under the same GPLv3 license, meaning that derivatives of p5play must also be open source. However, I would prefer that derivatives only exist for the purpose of contributing back to the main p5play library, for the benefit of the p5play community.

## p5play logos

The current p5play logos were created by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. The p5play logo can be found in the "assets" folder of this p5play-web repository in a file named "logo.svg". You can not use it to imply a derivative work is original or was created by Quinton Ashley. You are encouraged to reference it and/or the "made_with_p5play.png" images in your own projects to show that your project was made with p5play, but you may not imply that your project is endorsed by Quinton Ashley.

## p5.play v1 and v2

p5.play v1 and v2 are licensed under the LGPLv2 license, a more permissive copyleft license than GPLv3. p5play v3 does not qualify as a derivative of previous versions because it is a complete re-implementation of the p5play API. APIs are not copyrightable in the United States, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Oracle v Google case.

## p5play.org website

The example code and non-logo images shown in the mini-editors on the p5play website are public domain works licensed under the CC0 license. You are free to copy and modify them for use in your own projects without attribution.

The lessons and everything else in this repository, "p5play-web", is owned by Quinton Ashley, all rights reserved. This content is publicly available to be read and referenced in your own projects, but you may not copy the content to a greater extent than fair use allows without permission from Quinton Ashley.

## Contributions to p5play

Any contributions made to the p5play library, p5play editor app, and/or p5play.org become the property of Quinton Ashley, unless a superseding agreement is arranged. By contributing to the p5play and p5play-web repositories, you forfeit any copyright claims over your contributions for the benefit of the p5play community. Any contributions to the p5play library will be credited on the home page of p5play.org and in the p5play changelog on GitHub unless you'd prefer to make contributions anonymously.
