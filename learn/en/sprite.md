## Get started!

The code inside the p5.js (or q5.js) `setup` function runs when the program starts. The `new Canvas()` constructor creates a section of the screen that the program can draw on.

The p5.js `draw` function is run 60 times per second by default. The `background` function can be used to fill the canvas with a color each time it is drawn.

Try changing the width and height of the canvas (the numbers inside the `Canvas` constructor), then restart the example program!
