## Advanced Topics

These reference pages highlight some of the more advanced features of p5play.

You should probably read the other reference pages first!

## Canvas

The `Canvas` class is a wrapper around p5play's version of the p5.js `createCanvas` function, which is used to create an HTML5 canvas element. p5play's version also provides a few extra features.

If no parameters are passed to `new Canvas()`, it will create a canvas that fills the entire window.

You can also pass an aspect ratio to the Canvas constructor. This will create the largest possible canvas that fits within the window, while maintaining the given aspect ratio. For example, `new Canvas('2:1')` will create a canvas that is twice as wide as it is tall.

Another added feature is the "pixelated" preset. Use it for 8-bit or 16-bit style games!

`new Canvas(256, 240, 'pixelated')`

By default, the "pixelated" preset scales the canvas to fit the screen while retaining its aspect ratio, but you can also define a custom scale by passing a number after the preset name. For example, "pixelated x2" will create a canvas that will be displayed at twice the size of the specified width and height.
		</script>
			<!-- <script type="mie/p5" title="pixelated preset">
function setup() {
	//       (width, height, preset)
	new Canvas(256, 240, 'pixelated x2');
}
function draw() {
	clear();
}

## sprite.sleeping

"Sleeping" sprites get temporarily ignored during physics simulation. A sprite starts "sleeping" when it stops moving and doesn't collide with anything that it wasn't already touching. Allowing non-moving sprites to sleep is good for performance but sometimes you may need to wake up a non-moving sprite. You can disable sleeping completely by setting `world.allowSleeping = false`, or on a per sprite basis by setting `sprite.allowSleeping = false`, or to wake up a sleeping sprite you can `sprite.sleeping = false`.
		</script>
			<div class="minis horiz">
				<script type="mie/p5" name="sleeping" horiz>
let ball, floor;

function setup() {
	new Canvas(80, 240);
	world.gravity.y = 10;
	ball = new Sprite(40, 30, 50);
	floor = new Sprite(40, 155, 80, 5, 's');
}

function draw() {
	clear();
	if (frame == 100)	floor.rotation = 10;
}
			</script>
				<script type="mie/p5" name="wake up!" horiz>
let ball, floor;

function setup() {
	new Canvas(80, 256);
	world.gravity.y = 10;
	ball = new Sprite(40, 30, 50);
	floor = new Sprite(40, 155, 80, 5, 's');
}

function draw() {
	clear();
	if (frame == 100)	{
		ball.sleeping = false;
		floor.rotation = 10;
	}
}

## autoDraw, autoStep, and autoUpdate

By default, after each time the p5.js draw function is run, p5play calls three functions in this order:

- `allSprites.draw()` : draws all sprites
- `world.step()` : progresses the physics simulation
- `allSprites.update()` : updates sprite.ani and sprite.mouse

But you can also take manual control of these processes by calling them yourself.

In the mini-example, try pressing space to toggle slow-motion!

## sprite.draw and group.draw

You can use the `sprite.draw` and `group.draw` functions to manually control when individual sprites and groups are drawn inside the p5.js draw loop. Any sprites not drawn manually will be automatically drawn at the end of the p5.js draw loop unless the sprite's autoDraw property is set to false directly or by one of its parent groups. To prevent automatic drawing completely set `allSprites.autoDraw = false`.

Note that you will have to manually turn the camera on and off if you want to use it with manually drawn sprites.
		</script>
			<script type="mie/p5" name="world.step">
let ball, box;
		
function setup() {
	new Canvas(500, 192);

	ball = new Sprite(250, 100, 20);
	ball.speed = 10;
	ball.direction = 45;
	ball.bounciness = 1;
	ball.friction = 0;
	ball.strokeWeight = 0;

	box = new Sprite(250, 96, 490, 180, 's');
	box.shape = 'chain';
}

function draw() {
	if (kb.pressing('space')) {
		background(0, 0, 0, 30);
		allSprites.draw();
		world.step(1/240);
	} else {
		background(0);
	}
}
		</script>
			<script type="text/md">
## world.step

`world.step` checks for collisions and calculates the positions and velocities of all sprites after progressing the physics simulation by 1/60th of a second by default. Sprites can't be progressed forward in time individually.

Before you use `world.step` in your p5.js draw function, be sure to draw all the sprites. Otherwise, they will be drawn in the wrong position!

Set `world.autoStep = false` to disable automatic stepping. Then you can call `world.step` manually whenever you want to progress the physics simulation.
		</script>
			<script type="text/md">
## sprite.update and group.update

What does `sprite.update` do? It's responsible for updating the sprite's animation and mouse events. It also runs the user's custom update function if they set any.

Why is this functionality seperated from the world step? Because on a pause screen the physics world could be paused, but pause menu UI animations and mouse events could still be updated.
