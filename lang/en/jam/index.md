["Into the Mines"](https://tezumie.github.io/into-the-mines) is an open world platformer game. You play as a bearded miner who can climb walls and use a magic grappling axe!

This game won because of its incredible pixel art, level design, and fluid player controls. Take a look at the game's [code](https://github.com/Tezumie/into-the-mines) to see how Tezumie used p5play's `contro` interface for game controller input.

In ["Puzzling Magnetism Recharged"](https://kevin98799.itch.io/puzzling-magnetism-recharged) you play as two characters with opposite magnetic charges that can push or pull boxes respective to their magnetism.

This game won because it's unique and has a progressively challenging level design. Check out game's [code](https://v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/7146864/sketch.js) to see how Kevin made great use of p5play's `Tiles` constructor.
