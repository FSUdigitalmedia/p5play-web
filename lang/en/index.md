“I was looking at the new p5play (v3) yesterday and realized it had been so long since I tried it! I didn't realize it had physics built into it. I would LOVE to make some videos with it. This is such wonderful work, thank you for supporting the community in this way!”

# r10

“I have found the p5play library to be an invaluable resource for introducing students to game design and development. Our team chose to use this library for our Game Design Summer Program due to its many customizable features, well documented resources, and easy-to-use API which make it accessible for students of all ages and skill levels.

Due to the many methods and properties included in this library, students are able to quickly bring their game visions to life with code. These games range from basic catcher games to games with multiple levels and challenging features.

In addition to the library's well-documented resources, p5play offers a wealth of support and inspiration for the students and teachers in their community. This includes their interactive learn pages that allow students to tinker with different properties and methods in the library, their tri-annual Game Jam event, and their Discord channel filled with many great resources and opportunities to find support.

Our Girls Who Code team highly recommends this library to anyone interested in game development. We can't wait to see all of the games our students create this summer with this incredible library!”

# r20

“I recently got a chance to work with Quinton and do a deep dive into the p5play library. Video game design is such a
great entrypoint for engaging students in programming projects, while introducing them to the structure of object
oriented programming in p5. I can't wait to see what my students create with this!”

# r30

“I absolutely love what you've done with the Learn pages, what a cool reference for important sprite properties, looking forward to seeing more of that. Digging through the source a bit I'd say [p5play v3] retains a ton of the appeal of earlier versions and I was able to orient pretty quick.”

# r40

“I added a unit centered on p5play to my Artistic Coding and Game Design curriculum as a way to tease object oriented programming. Students quickly adapted to sprites and groups and were beyond excited about all the interactivity built into p5play. Through games, students were able to solidify their understanding of properties and methods without even realizing they were learning some of the core concepts of object oriented programming.

My students spent time making games using the p5play library and were immensely proud of their accomplishments. Since we have used p5play, my students are now better able to understand classes and have even written some of their own!”

# r50

“I've been using variations of p5play for several years in my middle school CS class. While it was serviceable before, it was nothing like what you've done with version 3. I LOVE it! Even my younger students can be successful and learn basic coding concepts because they don't really need to know all the math and physics behind the code now. Plus everything is consistent and streamlined so new ideas make sense. Then there's your amazing new website with so many easy to understand examples. I can send my advanced students directly to the p5play website and they can just explore and build anything they want. Thank you so much for all your work!”

# r60

“p5play has been a great addition to our curriculum. It has allowed us to explore a more creative outlet for learning object orientated programming and has been invaluable in their students projects for their exams.

Since introducing p5 and p5play we have seen an uptake of over 100% for students and are now seeing huge benefits to students learning. I would highly recommend introducing p5 & p5play into your curriculum. We have now developed a bespoke series of video tutorials to allow more schools and colleges in the UK to introduce p5play to their curriculum.”

# r70

“Thank you so much for all the work Quinton. With this proper physics integration, I may start using p5play again in my classes!”

# r80

“Overall, I can't recommend p5play enough. It has provided an incredibly easy way to take my game development skills to the next level without having to learn some complicated game development software. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I think you'll find that p5play is a valuable tool to have in your arsenal.”

# r90

“Using the library p5play in JavaScript in order to make graphical programs is a lot better then learning Python, because you get to see your program code influence something on screen.” - Student at Wyke

# r100

“Learning p5play has really helped me get more interested in coding, as it makes creating games very easy. It makes the process less time consuming and more fun!” - Student at Wyke

# r110

“I've used Tkinter in Python, which was useful to make basic applications. However, now using p5play we can make far more advanced games that are interesting and practical.” - Student at Wyke

## Why do Computer Science educators love p5play?! 😍

The [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) graphics library is already popular among CS educators, so p5play is a natural addition to many curriculums.

p5play is great for teaching Object Oriented Programming concepts. Instead of manipulating abstract data in a console, students can create game objects called [sprites](../learn/sprite.html) that they can see and physically interact with. Students can also learn about arrays and class-like inheritance by using [groups](../learn/group.html).

p5play is also entirely code based, so students don't need a specialized editor app to use it (unlike with Unity). With p5play, students gain practical, transferrable JavaScript programming skills and experience with online code editors or industry standard IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

p5play is also well designed and documented. Check out the [Learn pages](../learn), a free resource packed with interactive examples and exercises.

## Why should students learn p5play? 🤔

Every EdTech company claims their "easy and fun to use" software empowers students to "realize their creative potential", but often it's just marketing fluff.

If these platforms are so fun and creatively empowering, why are students only using them to complete assignments? It hardly matters how easy something is if students don't see the point in learning it.

p5play is different! It has all the features that students could want from a game engine: physics based contact handling, input detection, animations, a camera, joints, and more.

Since p5play is web based, students can share their projects online. That's not so easy to do with a Python, C#, or Java project. Being able to share projects with family and friends can motivate students to make something worth sharing!

# 17-2

## What about Scratch? 🐯

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is great for students ages 8-11, but older students have higher expectations that Scratch can't meet.

One of the biggest problems: Scratch has no built-in physics engine. That means even something super easy to make in p5play, like a ball rolling down a slope, requires a lot of math and is incredibly tedious to implement in Scratch's block based environment.

The featured games on the Scratch website are inspiring to students, but they were made by adults with extreme patience. If a student is really determined to make an impressive game in Scratch, they'll probably have to spend 20 hours copy pasting from YouTube tutorials. With p5play, students can get results way faster and with less frustration.

# 17-3

## Why was p5play created? 🎨

p5play was created to definitively bridge the gap between Scratch and professional game engines like Unity, which are too complex for beginners and not suited for general CS education.

Yet, p5play isn't limited to classroom use. It's powered by the [Box2D](https://github.com/piqnt/planck.js) physics engine. The same physics engine that powers beloved and commercially successful games like Angry Birds!

**"Only the best is good enough"** - Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, founder of LEGO

p5play faces no legitimate competition in the EdTech or game engine space among its target demographic of middle and high school students.

## Special Thanks 🙌

I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid! I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, and daughter, Luna, for their support and encouragement. 💞

In addition, I appreciate the Colombian government 🇨🇴 of Gustavo Petro for giving extended visas to digital nomads. If I still lived in US, p5play probably wouldn't exist. I couldn't afford to spend countless hours on a passion project like this one.
