## Special Thanks 🙌

I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid! I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, and daughter, Luna, for their support and encouragement. 💞

In addition, I appreciate the Colombian government 🇨🇴 of Gustavo Petro for giving extended visas to digital nomads. If I still lived in US, p5play probably wouldn't exist. I couldn't afford to spend countless hours on a passion project like this one.
