## What is p5play?

p5play is an accessible _and_ powerful platform for creating games and art with code.

It was designed to inspire people to learn Computer Science and enable professional game development.

p5play provides beginners with immediate, tangible results. It cuts boilerplate code to an absolute minimum by making sensible assumptions, ensuring that users only write code that's impactful and easy to understand.

# why

## Why use p5play?

Many other CS education tools offer ease of use through over-simplification, but thereby have limited or no practical use outside an intro level academic setting.

p5play is different because it rewards learners with depth and flexibility. When students feel they're gaining practical skills, not just doing work "for school", they stay engaged and excited about learning.

# free

## Why is p5play free?

p5play v3 is free (open source) because I think every student should be able to have fun while learning how to code.

# demos

## Can I see some demos?

# thanks

## Special Thanks

I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid!

I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, for her support and encouragement.ðŸ’ž

I'd like to thank all my teachers, especially my junior year English teacher, Mr. Williams, and my favorite NYU professors: Joanna Klukowska, Leigh Ann DeLyser, Lawrence Ferrara, and Langdon Crawford.

I'd also like to thank the Colombian government ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ of Gustavo Petro for giving extended visas to digital nomads, making it easy for remote workers like me to live and work here in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. If I still lived in US, p5play probably wouldn't exist. I couldn't afford to spend countless hours on a passion project like this one.

Big thanks to Paolo Pedercini for creating p5.play (v1) and trusting me to take over the project! Also thank you Erin Catto, creator of Box2D, for creating such an incredible physics engine and thanks to Ali Shakiba, creator of planck.js, a JavaScript port of Box2D.

If you want more info about why I made p5play (v3), read the ["p5play Version 3"](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/p5play-Version-3) wiki article and my [developer log](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/Developer-Log)!
