## About

p5play is an accessible _and_ powerful platform for creating games and art with code. It was designed to both inspire people to learn Computer Science and enable commercial game development.

p5play provides beginners with immediate, tangible results. But unlike many other CS education tools, it also rewards learners with depth in the form of a powerful, flexible, and extensible framework.

p5play (v3) and p5play.org was created by Quinton Ashley.

If you want more info about why I made p5play (v3), read the ["p5play Version 3"](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/p5play-Version-3) wiki article and my [developer log](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/Developer-Log).

If you'd like to see some demos of games and art I've made with p5play, check out my [OpenProcessing page](https://openprocessing.org/user/350295?o=35&view=sketches).
