## About

p5play is an accessible _and_ powerful platform for creating games and art with code, which inspires people to learn Computer Science!

While there are plenty of accessible CS education platforms which can spark student's initial interest, they're often too limited, via sandbox-ing or technical deficiency, to enable more practical or commercially viable outlets for creative expression. Thus, students can perceive the process of learning how to use these tools as a meaningless academic exercise, or at best, as prerequisite preparation for learning more practical "real-world" skills.

Game engines like Unity are powerful but too specialized to be used in general CS curriculums.

I want p5play to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or ability.

p5play (v3) and p5play.org was created by Quinton Ashley.

If you want more info about why I made p5play (v3), read the ["p5play Version 3"](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/p5play-Version-3) wiki article and my [developer log](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/Developer-Log).

If you'd like to see some demos of games and art I've made with p5play, check out my [OpenProcessing page](https://openprocessing.org/user/350295?o=35&view=sketches).
