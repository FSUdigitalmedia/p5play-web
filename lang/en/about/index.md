## What is p5play?

p5play is an accessible _and_ powerful platform for creating games and art with code. It was designed to inspire people to learn Computer Science and enable professional game development.

p5play provides beginners with immediate, tangible results. It cuts boilerplate code to an absolute minimum by making sensible assumptions, ensuring that users only write code that's impactful and easy to understand.

# why

## Why use p5play?

Many other CS education tools offer ease of use through simplicity, but thereby have limited or no practical use outside an intro level academic setting. p5play is different because it rewards learners with depth and flexibility. When students feel they're gaining practical skills, not just doing work "for school", it's a great way to keep them engaged and excited about learning.

# free

## Why is p5play free?

p5play v3 is free (open source) because I believe anyone should be able to learn to code, and have fun doing so!

# demos

## Can I see some demos?

If you'd like to see some demos of games and art I've made with p5play, which showcase p5play's capabilities better than the simple examples on the learn pages, check out my [OpenProcessing profile](https://openprocessing.org/user/350295?o=35&view=sketches).

# thanks

## Special Thanks

I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid! I'd like to thank all my public school teachers, especially my junior year English teacher, Mr. Williams.

I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, for her support and encouragement.ðŸ’ž

I'd also like to thank the Colombian government ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ of Gustavo Petro for giving extended visas to digital nomads, making it easy for remote workers like me to live and work here in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. If I still lived in US, p5play wouldn't exist. I'd be too busy working a second job, and thus unable to spend countless hours on a passion project like this one.

I attended NYU and took all of the core computer science courses at NYU CAS and also NYU Steinhardt's "Teaching of Computer Science" course. Shoutout to my favorite professors: Joanna Klukowska, Leigh Ann DeLyser, Lawrence Ferrara, and Langdon Crawford. Before deciding to teach full time I worked as a Node.js Software Developer at QTUltrasound, a medical device company based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Now I've been tutoring and teaching for 4 years. I've learned a lot from hundreds of students about what works and what doesn't. I've used p5play in my classes for 2 years, and I've seen how it can inspire students to learn and create.

I created p5play v3 for educating the next generation of programmers! If you want more info about why I made p5play (v3), read the ["p5play Version 3"](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/p5play-Version-3) wiki article and my [developer log](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/wiki/Developer-Log).
