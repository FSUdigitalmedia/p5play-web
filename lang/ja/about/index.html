          <p>
            p5play is an accessible <em>and</em> powerful platform for creating
            games and art with code. It was designed to inspire people to learn
            Computer Science and enable professional game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            p5play provides beginners with immediate, tangible results. It cuts
            boilerplate code to an absolute minimum by making sensible
            assumptions, ensuring that users only write code that's impactful
            and easy to understand.

        <md id="why"><h2 id="why-use-p5play">Why use p5play?</h2>
          <p>
            Many other CS education tools offer ease of use through
            over-simplification, but thereby have limited or no practical use
            outside an intro level academic setting. p5play is different because
            it rewards learners with depth and flexibility. When students feel
            they're gaining practical skills, not just doing work "for school",
            they stay engaged and excited about learning.

            what other people are making with p5play.

        <md id="free"><h2 id="why-is-p5play-free">Why is p5play free?</h2>
          <p>
            p5play v3 is free (open source) because I think every student should
            be able to have fun while learning how to code.

            Hi I'm Quinton, the creator of p5play (v3) and p5play.org. I'm a
            Computer Science teacher, tutor, and mentor at
            <a href="https://www.crimsoneducation.org/">Crimson Education</a>. I
            teach AP CS Principles, AP CS A, IGSCE CS, and Game Design
            Principles.

        <md id="thanks" class="full"><h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
          <p>
            I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for
            enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid!
          </p>
          <p>
            I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, for her support and
            encouragement.ðŸ’ž
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to thank all my teachers, especially my junior year English
            teacher, Mr. Williams, and my favorite NYU professors: Joanna
            Klukowska, Leigh Ann DeLyser, Lawrence Ferrara, and Langdon
            Crawford.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd also like to thank the Colombian government ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ of Gustavo Petro
            for giving extended visas to digital nomads, making it easy for
            remote workers like me to live and work here in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. If
            I still lived in US, p5play probably wouldn't exist. I couldn't
            afford to spend countless hours on a passion project like this one.
          </p>
