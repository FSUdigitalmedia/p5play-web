## Winter 2022 winner: [@kevin98799](https://kevin98799.itch.io)

In ["Puzzling Magnetism Recharged"](https://kevin98799.itch.io/puzzling-magnetism-recharged) you play as two characters with opposite magnetic charges that can push or pull boxes respective to their magnetism.

This game won because it's unique and has a progressively challenging level design. The code also makes great use of Groups and the Tiles constructor.

Big congrats to Kevin! ðŸ¥³
