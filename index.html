						<p>‚ÄúI have found the p5play library to be an invaluable resource for introducing students to
							game design and development. Our team chose to use this library for our Game Design Summer
							Program due to its many customizable features, well documented resources, and easy-to-use
							API which make it accessible for students of all ages and skill levels.</p>
						<p>Due to the many methods and properties included in this library, students are able to quickly
							bring their game visions to life with code. These games range from basic catcher games to
							games with multiple levels and challenging features.</p>
						<p>In addition to the library's well-documented resources, p5play offers a wealth of support and
							inspiration for the students and teachers in their community. This includes their
							interactive learn pages that allow students to tinker with different properties and methods
							in the library, their tri-annual Game Jam event, and their Discord channel filled with many
							great resources and opportunities to find support.</p>
						<p>Our Girls Who Code team highly recommends this library to anyone interested in game
							development. We can't wait to see all of the games our students create this summer with this
							incredible library!‚Äù</p>

					<p>Using p5play in your middle or high school curriculum is a great way to get your students
						interested in object oriented programming.</p>
					<p>Quinton Ashley, the creator of p5play v3, offers Professional Development sessions for teachers.
						Even if you're not a "gamer" and have no experience with game design, you can become an expert
						at teaching p5play! Your students will love making their own games and interactive art. During
						my PD course you'll receive advice on curriculum design, analysis of student work, curated
						resources for your students to use, and more!</p>
					<p>Inquire about Professional Development via email: <a href="mailto:info@p5play.org"

					<p>If your school has a Computer Science teacher, tell them about p5play!</p>
					<p>If not, Quinton Ashley, the creator of p5play v3, teaches the following courses online: AP
						Computer Science Principles, AP CS A, IGCSE Computer Science, and more. Learn standards aligned
						CS in a fun way!</p>
					<p>Quinton also teaches Game Design Fundamentals. Level up your programming skills by learning how
						to use p5play. I'll help you design your own game and share it with the world!</p>
					<p>Ask your parents to send an email to <a href="mailto:info@p5play.org"

					<h2 id="why-do-computer-science-educators-love-p5play-üòç">Why do Computer Science educators love
						p5play?! üòç</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> graphics library is already popular
						among CS educators, so p5play is a natural addition to many curriculums.</p>
					<p>p5play is great for teaching Object Oriented Programming concepts. Instead of manipulating
						abstract data in a console, students can create game objects called <a
							href="../learn/sprite.html" target="_blank">sprites</a> that they can see and physically
						interact with. Students can also learn about arrays and class-like inheritance by using <a
							href="../learn/group.html" target="_blank">groups</a>.</p>
					<p>p5play is also entirely code based, so students don't need a specialized editor app to use it
						(unlike with Unity). With p5play, students gain practical, transferrable JavaScript programming
						skills and experience with online code editors or industry standard IDEs like <a
							href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p>
					<p>p5play is also well designed and documented. Check out the <a href="../learn"
							target="_blank">Learn pages</a>, a free resource packed with interactive examples and
						exercises.</p>

					<h2 id="why-should-students-learn-p5play-ü§î">Why should students learn p5play? ü§î</h2>
					<p>Every EdTech company claims their "easy and fun to use" software empowers students to "realize
						their creative potential", but often it's just marketing fluff.</p>
					<p>If platforms like <a href="https://microbit.org/" target="_blank">micro:bit</a> are so fun and
						creatively empowering, why are students only using them to complete assignments? It hardly
						matters how easy something is if students don't see the point in learning it.</p>
					<p>p5play is different. It has all the features that students could want from a game engine: physics
						based contact handling, input detection, animations, a camera, joints, and more!</p>
					<p>Since p5play is web based, students can easily share their projects online. That's not so easy to
						do with a Python, C#, or Java project. Being able to share projects with family and friends can
						motivate students to make something worth sharing!</p>

				<md id="md17-2" class="closed">
					<h2 id="what-about-scratch-üêØ">What about Scratch? üêØ</h2>
					<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is great for students ages 8-11,
						but older students have higher expectations that Scratch can't meet. That's because Scratch has
						no built-in physics engine. That means even something super easy to make in p5play, like a ball
						rolling down a slope, requires a lot of math and is incredibly tedious to implement in Scratch's
						block based environment.</p>
					<p>The games featured on the Scratch website can be inspiring for students, until they realize that
						nearly all of them were created by adults! If a student is really determined to make an
						impressive game in Scratch, they'll spend 20 hours copy pasting from YouTube tutorials.</p>

				<md id="md17-3" class="closed">
					<h2 id="why-was-p5play-created-üé®">Why was p5play created? üé®</h2>
					<p>p5play was created to definitively bridge the gap between Scratch and professional game engines
						like Unity, which are too complex for beginners and not suited for general CS education.</p>
					<p>Yet, p5play isn't limited to classroom use. It's powered by the <a
							href="https://github.com/piqnt/planck.js" target="_blank">Box2D</a> physics engine. The same
						physics engine that powers beloved and commercially successful games like Angry Birds!</p>
					<p><strong>"Only the best is good enough"</strong> - Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, founder of LEGO</p>
					<p>p5play faces no legitimate competition in the EdTech or game engine space among its target
						demographic of middle and high school students.</p>
