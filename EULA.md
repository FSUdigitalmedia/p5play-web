# End User License Agreement (EULA)

p5play is a sole proprietorship owned and operated by Quinton Ashley ("p5play"). p5play is a JavaScript game engine, that provides a platform for making games and art projects ("Content"). You are a user of p5play ("User").

By using p5play, you agree to the terms of this End User License Agreement (EULA).

You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using p5play. You also agree not to use p5play to create any content that is illegal, harmful, or infringes on the rights of others.

p5play will not show ads to users while they are creating content with p5play, unless they are using p5play's advertising tools. p5play's advertising tools are a planned feature that will allow users to implement ads in their programs. Users would receive 100% of the revenue generated by their ads.

However, p5play also reserves the right to display its own advertisements on any published content that was made with p5play. Users would not receive any monetary compensation for these ads shown on their content. This monetization strategy is similar to social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, where ads may be shown before or after a user's content without any financial benefit to the user who created the content. If p5play decides to implement this monetization strategy, it will likely only be for incredibly popular content and if possible, users will be notified 24 hours in advance with a reminder of this EULA.

p5play may modify this EULA from time to time. Your continued use of p5play after the changes take effect will indicate your acceptance of the modified EULA.

This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between you and p5play regarding your use of the p5play software and any content made with it. If any provision of this EULA is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
