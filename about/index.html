				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					p5play (v3) was created by Quinton Ashley.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's the successor to
					p5.play (v1), which was created by Paolo Pedercini and other collaborators including Brad Buchanan, Atul
					Varma,
					and Jared Sprague. p5play (v3) uses
					portions of the original APIs but the underlying code was
					completely rewritten.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why did I make v3? I wanted to take advantage
					of new JavaScript features added during the 7
					years since p5.play was created. v3 also
					uses a JavaScript port of Box2D called planck.js behind the
					scenes to simulate physics, allowing for ~3x the
					amount of sprites on screen compared to v2!

					A ton of new features were added to version 3 so users could
					develop more interesting and complex games. Yet, it's just
					as easy, or even easier, to use v3 to make simple projects.

						Version 3"</a> wiki article.
