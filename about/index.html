				<h2 id="why-do-computer-science-educators-love-p5play-😍">Why do Computer Science educators love
					p5play?! 😍</h2>
				<p>The <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> graphics library is already popular among
					CS educators, so p5play is a natural addition to many curriculums.</p>
				<p>p5play is great for teaching Object Oriented Programming concepts. Instead of manipulating abstract
					data in a console, students can create game objects called <a href="../learn/sprite.html"
						target="_blank">sprites</a> that they can see and physically interact with. Students can also
					learn about arrays and class-like inheritance intuitively by using <a href="../learn/group.html"
						target="_blank">groups</a>.</p>
				<p>p5play is also entirely code based, so students don't need a specialized editor app to use it (unlike
					with Unity). With p5play, students gain practical, transferrable JavaScript programming skills and
					experience with online code editors or industry standard IDEs like <a
						href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p>
				<p>p5play is also well designed and documented. Check out the <a href="../learn" target="_blank">Learn
						pages</a>, a free resource packed with interactive examples and exercises.</p>

				<h2 id="why-should-students-learn-p5play-🤔">Why should students learn p5play? 🤔</h2>
				<p>Every EdTech company claims their "easy and fun to use" software empowers students to "realize their
					creative potential", but often it's just marketing fluff.</p>
				<p>If platforms like <a href="https://microbit.org/" target="_blank">micro:bit</a> are so fun and
					creatively empowering, why are students only using them to complete assignments? It hardly matters
					how easy something is if students don't see the point in learning it.</p>
				<p>p5play is different. It has all the features that students could want from a game engine: physics
					based contact handling, input detection, animations, a camera, joints, and more!</p>
				<p>Since p5play is web based, students can be motivated to make something they'd be proud to share with
					the world. With Python, C#, or Java projects, that's just not possible.</p>

				<h2 id="what-about-scratch-🐯">What about Scratch? 🐯</h2>
				<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is a great tool for teaching
					programming to kids ages 8-11, but older students have high expectations and Scratch can't really
					deliver. The main issue is there's no built-in physics engine. That means even something super easy
					to make in p5play, like a ball rolling down a slope, requires a lot of math and is incredibly
					tedious to implement in Scratch.</p>
				<p>The few good Scratch games featured on the website can be inspiring for students, until they realize
					that nearly all of them were created by adults! If a student is really determined to make an
					impressive game in Scratch, they'll need to spend 20 hours copy pasting from YouTube tutorials.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile I'm over here getting humbled by what 14 year olds can do with p5play!</p>
			</md>
			<md id="md0-3">
				<h2 id="why-did-you-create-p5play">Why did you create p5play?</h2>
				<p>I created p5play (v3) to definitively bridge the gap between Scratch and professional game engines
					like Unity, which are too complex for beginners and not suited for general CS education.</p>
				<p>Yet, I didn't want p5play to be limited to classroom use, so it's powered by the <a
						href="https://github.com/piqnt/planck.js" target="_blank">Box2D</a> physics engine, enabling the
					creation of pro level games with impressive physics.</p>
				<p><strong>"Only the best is good enough"</strong> - Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, founder of LEGO</p>
				<p>In my (super biased) opinion, p5play faces no legitimate competition in the EdTech or game engine
					space among its target demographic of middle and high school students. Kaboom! is so poorly and
					oddly designed that it shouldn't be used to teach general programming. Phaser's matter.js physics
					engine is far worse than Box2D, loading animations is tediously verbose, and it requires too much
					boilerplate code.</p>
				<p>If there was a better option out there, I would have used it instead of creating p5play!</p>

				<p>I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for enrolling me in coding classes when

					encouragement. 💞</p>
				<p>In addition, I appreciate the Colombian government 🇨🇴 of Gustavo Petro for giving extended visas to
					digital nomads. If I still lived in US, p5play probably wouldn't exist. I couldn't afford to spend
					countless hours on a passion project like this one.</p>
