          <p>
            p5play is an accessible <em>and</em> powerful platform for creating
            games and art with code. It was designed to inspire people to learn
            Computer Science and enable professional game development.
          </p>
          <p>
            p5play provides beginners with immediate, tangible results. It cuts
            boilerplate code to an absolute minimum by making sensible
            assumptions, ensuring that users only write code that's impactful
            and easy to understand.

        <md id="why"><h2 id="why-use-p5play">Why use p5play?</h2>
          <p>
            Many other CS education tools offer ease of use through simplicity,
            but thereby have limited or no practical use outside an intro level
            academic setting. p5play is different because it rewards learners
            with depth and flexibility. When students feel they're gaining
            practical skills, not just doing work "for school", it's a great way
            to keep them engaged and excited about learning.

          <p>
            If you'd like to see some demos of games and art I've made with
            p5play, which showcase p5play's capabilities better than the simple
            examples on the learn pages, check out my

        <md id="free"><h2 id="why-is-p5play-free">Why is p5play free?</h2>
          <p>
            p5play v3 is free (open source) because I believe anyone should be
            able to learn to code, and have fun doing so!

            Hi I'm Quinton, the creator of p5play (v3) and p5play.org. I'm a
            Computer Science teacher, tutor, and mentor at
            <a href="https://www.crimsoneducation.org/">Crimson Education</a>. I
            teach AP CS Principles, AP CS A, IGSCE CS, and Game Design
            Principles.

        <md id="thanks" class="full"><h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
          <p>
            I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for
            enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid! I'd like to thank
            all my public school teachers, especially my junior year English
            teacher, Mr. Williams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, for her support and
            encouragement.ðŸ’ž
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd also like to thank the Colombian government ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ of Gustavo Petro
            for giving extended visas to digital nomads, making it easy for
            remote workers like me to live and work here in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. If
            I still lived in US, p5play wouldn't exist. I'd be too busy working
            a second job, and thus unable to spend countless hours on a passion
            project like this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I attended NYU and took all of the core computer science courses at
            NYU CAS and also NYU Steinhardt's "Teaching of Computer Science"
            course. Shoutout to my favorite professors: Joanna Klukowska, Leigh
            Ann DeLyser, Lawrence Ferrara, and Langdon Crawford. Before deciding
            to teach full time I worked as a Node.js Software Developer at
            QTUltrasound, a medical device company based in the San Francisco
            Bay Area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I've been tutoring and teaching for 4 years. I've learned a lot
            from hundreds of students about what works and what doesn't. I've
            used p5play in my classes for 2 years, and I've seen how it can
            inspire students to learn and create.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created p5play v3 for educating the next generation of
            programmers! If you want more info about why I made p5play (v3),
