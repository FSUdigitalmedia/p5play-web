The p5.play website is hosted at https://p5play.org and is maintained by @quinton-ashley. This repository contains the source code for the website.

Want to display your own mini p5.js sketches on your website? Use [p5-mini][], a package I created for doing just that!

## p5.play Development

The following documentation is for _developing_ p5.play itself. If you
want to _use_ p5.play, please visit the website https://p5play.org

## Contributing to p5.play

First, take a look at the [p5.play project planning page][].

I recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension for development of p5.play.
