The p5play website is hosted at <https://p5play.org> and is maintained by @quinton-ashley. This repository contains the source code for the website.

Want to display your own mini p5.js sketches on your website? Use [mie][] (mini editor), a package I created for doing just that!

## Contributing to p5play

First, take a look at the [p5play project planning page][].

I recommend using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension for development of p5play.

## Licensing

The p5play v3 library itself is licensed under the GPLv3 only. I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that if you intend to make a derivative version of p5play, which means copying the library in part or whole and making your own edits to it, then you must release your work publicly under the GPLv3 only license as well. You can make commericial games using p5play, but you must release the source code for your game as well. If you would like to use p5play in a closed-source project, you must contact the sole copyright holder, Quinton Ashley, for permission: info@p5play.org

p5.play v2 and v1 are licensed under the LGPLv2 license. p5play v3 does not qualify as a derivative of previous versions because it is a complete reimplementation of the p5play API. APIs are not copyrightable in the United States, as decided by the Supreme Court in the Oracle v Google case.

The JavaScript example code shown in the mini-editors on the p5play website are licensed under the ISC license. You are free to copy and modify the code for your own projects without attribution.

The lessons on the p5play website are owned by Quinton Ashley and are not licensed for reuse. They are publicly available to be read and referenced in your own projects, but you may not copy them.

Any contributions made to the p5play v3 library or p5play.org become the intellectual property of Quinton Ashley for the benefit of the p5play community.
