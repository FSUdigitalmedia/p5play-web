The p5play website is hosted at <https://p5play.org> and is maintained by @quinton-ashley. This repository contains the source code for the website.

Want to display your own mini p5.js sketches on your website? Use [mie][] (mini editor), a package I created for doing just that!

## Contributing to p5play
