						Education Licensing</h2>
					<p>The "Learn" section of p5play.org is an interactive textbook I've been writing for the past two
						years. üë®‚Äçüè´ Making it publicly available during this time provided me with a lot of useful
						feedback, which I'm grateful for! üìñ</p>
					<p>Now that it's finished, this resource will still be free for personal use but educators/schools
						need to become <a href="https://p5play.org/pro/" target="_blank"><em>PRO</em> members</a> to use
						the Learn pages in class or coursework.</p>
					<p>The monthly subscription cost is fair and affordable: starting at only ~25¬¢ per student per
						month. That's only $100 a year, the same cost as just one textbook! üìö</p>

					<h2 id="why-charge-for-the-learn-pages">Why charge for the Learn pages?</h2>
					<p>I'm trying to strike a balance here between open source and monetization.</p>
					<p>p5play is open source because I think the only way to deeply learn how software works is being
						able to look at the source code. Teachers can still teach about p5play for free using their own
						lesson material, as long as it's made open source in compliance with the AGPL.</p>
					<p>But I also believe that the hundreds of hours I've put into writing the Learn pages has resulted
						in something of real value for CS educators. I hope you agree and will support this project!</p>

				<md id="md0-2" class="closed">
					<h2 id="why-not-use-ads">Why not use Ads?</h2>
					<p>Some p5play users have suggested I put advertisements before running student's code or on the
						Learn pages instead of charging schools to use them. I will never do that!</p>
					<p>I think it's unethical to sell student's attention to advertisers during instructional time or
						when they're doing coursework. I believe that schools should pay to provide high quality
						educational resources for their students, not essentially forcing their students to pay via ads.

					<h2 id="why-not-charge-for-advanced-features">Why not charge for advanced features?</h2>
					<p>I want to entice students to learn p5play by providing a lot of core features. This approach
						makes p5play different from a lot of Ed Tech platforms that are so basic they're only good for
						teaching intro level CS. As a student I felt like everything I was doing in school was just
						eternal preparation for the next thing. I want students to feel empowered by p5play!</p>
					<p>I don't expect teachers cover all of p5play's features during class, so charging for some
						features wouldn't be a good incentive.</p>

					<h2 id="but-big-tech-provides-free-learning-resources">But big tech provides free learning resources
					</h2>
					<p>p5play isn't some big corporation that can provide free learning resources and make money via
						other revenue streams. I need to find a way to sustain my work so this project doesn't die.</p>
					<p>I promise that if p5play ever gets institutional funding, I'll make the Learn pages completely
						free again.</p>

				<md id="md0-5" class="closed">
					<h2 id="what-if-my-school-wont-pay">What if my school won't pay?</h2>
					<p>If you think your school or district will not pay, please still petition them to do so. I can
						answer any questions they might have to try to persuade them. If they deny your request, don't
						misdirect your anger at me. I don't think any teacher should have to pay out of pocket for
						learning resources and supplies. If the cost of the p5play PRO membership is a legitimate
						barrier for you or your school, please let me know.</p>

					<h2 id="my-school-wants-a-custom-invoice">My school wants a custom invoice</h2>
					<p>If your school or university would prefer a custom one time invoice instead of a subscription, I
						can make one! Let me know how many students will use p5play and the duration of use.</p>

					<p>p5play now has +50,000 users a month. If every teacher who uses p5play gets their school to pay
